# Word Search
Mobile Developer Intern Word Search problem

Create a word search mobile app for Android or iOS (depending on the discipline youâ€™re applying to).
The word search should have at least a 10x10 grid.
Include at least the following 6 words: Swift, Kotlin, ObjectiveC, Variable, Java, Mobile.
Keep track of how many words a user has found.
Make sure it compiles successfully.
Bonus:
Randomize where the words are placed.
Make a slick UI with smooth animations.
Make it look good in portrait and landscape.
Feel free to add any additional features you can think of.
Allow the user to find the words by swiping over the words.


What you need to submit:
A screenshot of your app when no words have been found.
A screenshot of your app when all words have been found.
A link to your projects GitHub Repository


**Note: This is a word search- NOT a crossword**
